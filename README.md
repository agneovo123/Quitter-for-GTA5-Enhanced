[Be a Quitter - Solo Public Session and Game Killer Tool [GTA Online]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=252_ToLSUfI)

### Features:
 - Suspend game process for a customizeable amount of time (get a solo public lobby) [^1]
 - Terminate game process (escape modders/rce exploits) [^2]
   - can **optionally** terminate the quitter itself
 - Drop network connection for a customizeable amount of time [^3]

### Footnotes:
[^1]: Since the [whitchewer,idk DLC] you can do sell missions in solo/invite only lobbies. The only use I've found is to quickly get a new lobby when you start lagging.
[^2]: You can prevent the game from handling money/xp changes if you're quick enough to kill the game.
[^3]: You will need to run the program with administrator privileges
