Todo list:


[+] Processes:
    [+] Get processses
    [+] Suspend/Resume
    [+] Instatnt turn off (Kill)

[+] Hotkeys:
    [+] Get/Set
    [+] Save/Load
        [-] use the same format as Flexcreator's Quitter
            - it uses differend encoding(?)(values) for the keys
    [+] Intercept (while window is not in focus) [seems to work]

[+] Networking:
    [+] Select network 'card'
    [+] Turn on/off

[+] visuals:
    [+] dark mode, minimalistic
.

[ ] Should I add an 'All' button to networks?
     - it would disable/enable add found adapters instead of 1

[ ] prevent [possible(?)] double Dispose() in HotkeyHandler.UnregisterAll()
[ ] setting the same hotkey will fire an event
     - eg: set Terminate to DELETE, wait for autosave, set Terminate to DELETE again
	 - results in the terminate command running before it's unregistered.
	  - possible solution: start the unregistering on click, or enter, or focus; instead of the "TextChanged" event.
